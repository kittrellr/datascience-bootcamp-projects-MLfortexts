**Project Structure:** This project was completed for TripleTen's Data Science Program. Project 14: Machine Learning for Texts <br>
**Task:** Develop and assess a model to detect negative feedback of film reviews. <br>
**Skills:** Visualize film releases and film reviews from 1894 - 2020. Use regular expressions, pipeline, nltk library to preprocess review texts for modeling. Built a constant model and evaluated on several different strategies. <br>
Built, trained, and evaluated 5 different model types: Model 1 - NLTK, TF-IDF and LR, Model 2 - NLTK, TF-IDF and XGBoost, Model 3 - spaCy, TF-IDF and LR, Model 4 - spaCy, TF-IDF and LGBMClassifier, Model 5 - spaCy, TF-IDF and XGBoost. <br>
Created my own reviews to test models on and evaluate each. Created 2 strong models to analyze text sentiment and detect negative reviews.
